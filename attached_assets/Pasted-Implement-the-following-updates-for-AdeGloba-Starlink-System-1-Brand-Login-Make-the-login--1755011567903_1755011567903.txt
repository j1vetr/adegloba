Implement the following updates for AdeGloba Starlink System:

1) Brand & Login
- Make the login page brand fully managed from Admin > Ayarlar: upload logo (SVG/PNG), set width/height (px) and max-width%, remove all static text/placeholder branding.
- Render only the configured logo on the login screen; logo is clickable to "/".
- Ensure responsive scaling on mobile; no overflow.

2) Admin Menu Categorization
- In Admin panel sidebar, group items into categories:
  • Genel: Dashboard
  • Operasyon: Gemiler, Paketler, Kuponlar, Siparişler
  • Kullanıcı Yönetimi: Kullanıcılar
  • Sistem: Ayarlar, Loglar (opsiyonel)
- Collapsible category headers; preserve dark futuristic maritime theme.

3) User Panel Header Cleanup
- In the user panel top nav show only: "Ana Sayfa" (dashboard) and "Destek" (ticket sistemi).
- Remove all unused links/pages from header and routes.

4) Ticket Sistemi (User–Admin)
- Build a full two-way ticket system (Turkish UI) accessible in:
  • User panel: "Destek" (list, create, view, reply, close)
  • Admin panel: "Destek" (list all, filter by durum/öncelik/kullanıcı/gemi, assign to admin, reply, close)
- DB: tickets(id, user_id, ship_id, subject, priority[Dusuk/Orta/Yuksek], status[Açık/Beklemede/Kapalı], created_at, updated_at), ticket_messages(id, ticket_id, sender_type[user/admin], message, created_at), ticket_attachments(id, ticket_id, message_id, file_url, filename, size).
- Features: file upload (images/pdf ≤10MB), rich-text (basic), statuses & priorities, search + filters, pagination, unread counters, timestamps TR format.
- Permissions: users see only their own tickets; admins see all; audit-log minimal.
- Notifications: show in-app toasts/badges for new replies; optional email hooks (stub).
- Design: dark neon blue theme, responsive, no layout overflow; mobile-friendly message thread view.

5) General
- All text in Turkish; keep theme consistent (black + neon blue).
- Fully responsive; fix any overflow/alignment issues introduced by changes.
