Implement a user authentication and dashboard system with the following flow:

1. Login/Registration Gate:
- When a visitor enters the site, they must first see the login form ("/giris").
- If they don't have an account, they can click "Kayıt Ol" to go to the registration page ("/kayit").
- Registration fields (all labels in Turkish):
  - "Kullanıcı Adı"
  - "E-posta"
  - "Şifre"
  - "Gemi" (dropdown, populated from the "ships" table in admin panel)
  - "Adres" (textarea for full billing/shipping address)
- The "Gemi" dropdown must be populated from the "ships" table, which is managed via the admin panel (CRUD).
- Each registered user will be linked to one ship (ship_id in the users table).

2. Initial Ship Data:
- On first run, seed the "ships" table with the following active ships:
  LBC_OYKU
  NERMIN KARABEKIR
  TAMREY S
  LadyBerna
  MONA
  LBC_TUGCE
  AJOS
  HAVVA KARABEKIR
  BUNDU
  FORTUNATE
  FERTILE
  YUKSEL KARABEKIR
  NIKSAR
  GITO

3. User Dashboard:
- After login, redirect the user to their dashboard ("/panel").
- Dashboard sections:
  - "Paketlerim": Show current active packages for the user, including expiry dates.
  - "Geçmiş Satın Alımlar": List all previous purchases with package details and dates.
  - "Kullanım Bilgileri": Placeholder for future usage stats.
- Menu item: "Data Paketi Al" → goes to a page listing available packages for the user's ship.

4. Data Package Purchase Page:
- Display all packages assigned to the user's ship, fetched from the database.
- Package cards must have a futuristic design with animations (dark theme + neon accents + hover effects).
- Each card shows: package name, GB amount, price, speed note, validity note, and a "Satın Al" button.

5. Admin Panel Changes:
- Admin can manage ships (add/edit/delete).
- Admin can manage packages and assign them to ships.
- Admin can view users and see which ship they belong to, along with their address.
- Admin can view orders filtered by ship.

6. General:
- All UI text in Turkish.
- Fully responsive design.
- Passwords stored hashed (bcrypt).
